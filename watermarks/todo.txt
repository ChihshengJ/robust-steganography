refactor to make python module

make the model swappable (gpt-2, shakespeare, bGPT, etc) in clean way like other stego code

write get_limit function

make perturb, and model be swappable

try logging and comparing the prob dist before and after perturb

rename prf to add smooth
add sharp prf that zeros out entries and add quality warning
rename nanogpt to add shakespeare

convert attack files

I think a bunch of the global functions in nangpt.py can be removed and are never called

add back in config determinism

write attacks
    synonym attacks
    random reorder?
    within a certain levenshtein edit distance?
    ask chat gpt to rewrite them
