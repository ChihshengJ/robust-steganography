train new pca model on better distribution

test and iterate on one way monologue system prompt

make proper python package and fix imports accordingly

probably rename demo to system and example to demo or leave as example

refactor directory/file structure

write measurement code. it should be a folder to hold graphs and tables and the code to generate them

check for weird corruptions in padding head in error correction that could cause an exception to occur (like accessing past the end of the list). what is the worst case for convolutional codes?

write testing code
- hash functions
- steganography

need to test
- example.py
    - various combinations of real inputs
- example_simulation.py
    - convolutional code
    - hash block sizes that are not 1
    - ascii
- rerun unit test
    - add testing all encodings

currently users need to agree on block size ahead of time. can we make this dynamic? i think it needs to be the current way
