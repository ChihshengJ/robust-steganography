Toxic securities were owned by corporate and institutional investors globally. Derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions. The de-leveraging of financial institutions, as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets, further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade. Reductions in the growth rates of developing countries were due to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and remittances sent from migrant workers (example: Armenia).

                "Climate change poses a severe threat to global biodiversity. As temperatures rise, precipitation patterns shift, and extreme weather events become more frequent, many species are struggling to adapt. These changes affect ecosystems in profound ways, leading to mismatches in the timing of food availability, breeding cycles, and migrations. Coral reefs, often called the \"rainforests of the sea,\" are particularly vulnerable, with warming oceans causing coral bleaching and death. On land, species that cannot move to cooler habitats are at risk of extinction. The loss of biodiversity not only diminishes the beauty and richness of our natural world but also impacts human societies. Biodiversity underpins ecosystem services that are crucial for human survival, from pollination and water purification to soil fertility and flood control. Preserving biodiversity thus requires urgent global action to mitigate climate change and protect vulnerable habitats.",

It challenges the notion of determinism, the idea that all events, including human actions, are determined by preceding events in accordance with the natural laws. Philosophers who advocate for free will argue that individuals can make choices that are not just products of their environment or their genetic makeup. This has profound implications for morality and justice, as the existence of free will underpins our notions of responsibility and guilt. However, the debate takes on new complexity with advances in neuroscience that suggest our decisions may be influenced by brain activity before we are conscious of making them. This raises questions about the nature of autonomy and the extent to which we are truly free agents in controlling our actions and shaping our destinies.",

Future trends in urban development emphasize sustainability and resilience, incorporating green spaces, promoting public transportation, and using smart technologies to improve efficiency and reduce waste. Urban planners and policymakers are increasingly focused on creating inclusive cities that offer quality of life for all residents, regardless of their economic status. This involves not only physical infrastructure but also social programs that address issues like housing affordability and access to services. The future of urban development will likely see more integrated approaches that consider the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability."
